Here’s a breakdown of how it works:\n","\n","string.punctuation: This is a string containing all the punctuation characters (like !\"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_{|}~`).\n","\n","str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation): This method creates a translation table. The str.maketrans method takes three arguments: x, y, and z. In this case, x and y are empty strings, and z is string.punctuation. This means that all characters in string.punctuation will be mapped to None, effectively removing them.\n","\n","text.translate(...): This method uses the translation table created by str.maketrans to remove the specified characters (in this case, all punctuation) from text.\n","\n","So, if text contains punctuation, this expression will return a new string with all punctuation removed.\n","\n","\n","The str.maketrans method in Python creates a translation table that can be used with the str.translate method to perform text replacements or deletions.\n","\n","Here’s a more detailed explanation:\n","\n","str.maketrans(x, y, z): This method creates a translation table where:\n","x is a string of characters to be replaced.\n","y is a string of characters that will replace the characters in x (the same length as x).\n","z is a string of characters to be deleted from the text (optional).\n","When you call str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation), you are creating a translation table where:\n","\n","x is an empty string, meaning there are no characters to replace.\n","y is also an empty string, so no characters are replaced.\n","z is string.punctuation, which specifies all punctuation characters.\n","This results in a translation table that effectively removes all punctuation characters when used with str.translate."],"metadata":{"id":"71JTnINpoV7v"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import string\n","\n","def word_frequency(text):\n","    # Convert the text to lowercase\n","    text = text.lower()\n","\n","    # Remove punctuation\n","    text = text.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))\n","\n","    # Split the text into words\n","    words = text.split()\n","\n","    # Count the frequency of each word\n","    word_count = {}\n","    for word in words:\n","        if word in word_count:\n","            word_count[word] += 1\n","        else:\n","            word_count[word] = 1\n","\n","    # Sort the words in alphabetical order\n","    sorted_words = sorted(word_count.items())\n","\n","    # Print the frequency of each word\n","    for word, count in sorted_words:\n","        print(f'{word}: {count}')\n","\n","# Example usage\n","text = \"Hello, world!
